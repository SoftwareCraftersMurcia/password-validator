# Goal
Design and implement a software that validates a password applying TDD.

The password will be introduced by the user (as an argument of the method) and should return if the password is valid or not.

A valid password should meet the following requirements:

	 - Have more than 8 characters
	 - Contains a capital letter
	 - Contains a lowercase
	 - Contains a number
	 - Contains an underscore

# Technical requirements:

	- We want a method that answers if the password is valid or not.
	- We don't want to know the reason when the password is invalid (the return value is a boolean)
